Problem 1
---------

### Reading and manipulating the dataframe:

-   Created variable city\_state to include both city and state
-   Created binary variable case\_status to indicate whether the homicide is solved or unsolved
-   Omitted cities Dallas, TX; Phoenix, AZ; and Kansas City, MO because these locations donâ€™t report victim race
-   Omitted Tulsa, AL because this is a data entry mistake
-   Modified victim\_race to have categories white and non-white, with white as the reference category

``` r
homicide_data <- read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv", na = c("", "NA", "Unknown")) %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    case_status = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ "solved"),
    victim_race = case_when(
      victim_race == "Asian" ~ "non-white",
      victim_race == "Black" ~ "non-white",
      victim_race == "Hispanic" ~ "non-white",
      victim_race == "Other" ~ "non-white",
      victim_race == "White" ~ "white"),
    victim_race = factor(victim_race, levels = c("white", "non-white"))
  ) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Dallas, TX", 
         city_state != "Phoenix, AZ", 
         city_state != "Kansas City, MO", 
         city_state != "Tulsa, AL") %>% 
  select(-victim_first, -victim_last)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_integer(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_integer(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Is the variable victim\_age numeric? TRUE.
